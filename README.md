# IrcLogWatch
Bot which pings you when somebody who you were waiting for connect to channels

 * The configuration is done little bit uncomfortably inside "IrcLogWatch.jar". 
 * you need to enter this archive, and edit IrcLogWatch/settings.txt file (and pack it back of course)
 * at least the config file (where you put server address and channels and bot's name is pretty easy)
 * when bot is online just ask him for help.
 * eg private message "help" or public 'BB_watch help' (or different name)
 * then you will learn how to control it
 * be careful with it, or you will get ban
 * bot reacts both on private and public messages
